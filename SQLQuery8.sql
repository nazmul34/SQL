-- In this sql we will learn about, Derived tables and common table expressions (CTE's). We will also explore the differences between Views, Table Variable, 
-- Local and Global Temp Tables, 
-- Derived tables and common table expressions.

-- Let's create the required Employee and Department tables, that we will be using for this demo.

CREATE TABLE tblEmployee
(
  Id int Primary Key,
  Name nvarchar(30),
  Gender nvarchar(10),
  DepartmentId int
)

CREATE TABLE tblDepartment
(
 DeptId int Primary Key,
 DeptName nvarchar(20)
)

--Insert data into tblDepartment table
Insert into tblDepartment values (1,'IT')
Insert into tblDepartment values (2,'Payroll')
Insert into tblDepartment values (3,'HR')
Insert into tblDepartment values (4,'Admin')

--Insert data into tblEmployee table
Insert into tblEmployee values (1,'John', 'Male', 3)
Insert into tblEmployee values (2,'Mike', 'Male', 2)
Insert into tblEmployee values (3,'Pam', 'Female', 1)
Insert into tblEmployee values (4,'Todd', 'Male', 4)
Insert into tblEmployee values (5,'Sara', 'Female', 1)
Insert into tblEmployee values (6,'Ben', 'Male', 3)


-- Now, we want to write a query which would return the following output. The query should return, the Department Name and Total Number of employees, with in the department.
-- The departments with greatar than or equal to 2 employee should only be returned. Obviously, there are severl ways to do this

--Script to create the View
Create view vWEmployeeCount
as
Select DeptName, DepartmentId, COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees
from tblEmployee
join tblDepartment
on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
group by DeptName, DepartmentId

--Query using the view:
Select DeptName, TotalEmployees 
from vWEmployeeCount
where  TotalEmployees >= 2


-- Now, let's see, how to achieve the same using, temporary tables.


-- local temporary tables
-- replace #TempEmployeeCount with ##TempEmployeeCount to get the same thing for global temp veriables
Select DeptName, DepartmentId, COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees
into #TempEmployeeCount
from tblEmployee
join tblDepartment
on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
group by DeptName, DepartmentId

Select DeptName, TotalEmployees
From #TempEmployeeCount
where TotalEmployees >= 2

Drop Table #TempEmployeeCount


--Using Table Variable:
Declare @tblEmployeeCount table
(DeptName nvarchar(20),DepartmentId int, TotalEmployees int)

Insert @tblEmployeeCount
Select DeptName, DepartmentId, COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees
from tblEmployee
join tblDepartment
on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
group by DeptName, DepartmentId

Select DeptName, TotalEmployees
From @tblEmployeeCount
where  TotalEmployees >= 2


--Using Derived Tables:
Select DeptName, TotalEmployees
from 
 (
  Select DeptName, DepartmentId, COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees
  from tblEmployee
  join tblDepartment
  on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
  group by DeptName, DepartmentId
 ) 
as EmployeeCount
where TotalEmployees >= 2



--Using CTE:
With EmployeeCount(DeptName, DepartmentId, TotalEmployees)
as
(
 Select DeptName, DepartmentId, COUNT(*) as TotalEmployees
 from tblEmployee
 join tblDepartment
 on tblEmployee.DepartmentId = tblDepartment.DeptId
 group by DeptName, DepartmentId
)

Select DeptName, TotalEmployees
from EmployeeCount
where TotalEmployees >= 2
